### Running examples

**Note:** The examples are not starters - the dependencies are set up to work
locally within this repo. They can be adapted for standalone use, but are
intentionally not set up for it.

**Note:** Examples on the `main` branch use the `alpha` release. If you're not
installing the `alpha`, use the `latest` branch for docs and examples matching
the latest stable release.

1. Clone or fork the repo
2. Install root dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Change to one of the example directories and install dependencies

```bash
cd examples/<example-name>
npm install
```

4. If you haven't run this example before, initialize the database

```bash
npx convex dev --once
```

5. Run the example

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you're making changes to the component, open a separate terminal
and run the build watch task

```bash
npm run build:watch
```
